  <b>Zones for Covid-19:-</b><br>
  The Centre has issued new guidelines on Sunday, May 17, allowing states to decide the Red, Green and Orange zones so as to enable
  the state governments to reopen certain segments of the economy in parts.

In the containment zones, only essential activities will be allowed and a strict perimeter control will be put in place to ensure
there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except medical emergencies and essential goods and services.<br>
The Ministry of Home Affairs added that only essential activities will be permitted in containment zones and directed states to
prohibit or allow other activities as per their discretion. The barring of essential activities in just containment zones means
there is much likelihood of essential activities resuming in red zones.<br>

Earlier, on April 15, the Centre had announced the criteria for classifying districts into three zones depending on the number of
coronavirus cases. The list of districts in these zones was to be updated by the various states on a weekly basis, every Monday.<br>
Health is a state subject. The goal of the containment plan was to utilise the extended lockdown period to contain the spread of
COVID-19.<br>

  <p>Let us remind ourselves that our ancestors saw nature as mother, and asked us to respect it.
    At some point in history, we forgot ancient wisdom. When pandemics and abnormal weather phenomena are becoming the norm,
    it is time to pause and wonder where we lost the way, and how we can still make a comeback</p>
